This example portrays a configuration where all nodes are deployed on different machines. In this deployment:
 - `vitellone` is the hostname where `trento_server` gets deployed
 - `vitellone-pg` is where `postgres` gets deployed
 - `vitellone-mq` is where `rabbitmq` gets deployed
 - `vitellone-metrics` is where `prometheus` gets deployed
 - `hana01` and `hana02` are hosts where Trento agents get installed
