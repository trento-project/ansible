This example portrays a configuration where only Trento components,
server and agents, are deployed with configuration pointing to
external services outside of the scope of this playbook. In this
deployment:

 - `vitellone` is the hostname where Trento server gets deployed
 - `hana01` and `hana02` are hosts where Trento agents get installed
