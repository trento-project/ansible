# Trento Ansible

**THIS IS NOT PRODUCTION READY, HIGHLY WIP, USE AT OWN RISK**

**THE PLAYBOOK ASSUMES YOU ARE ON AN OPENSUSE LEAP 15.5 OR SUSE LINUX ENTERPRISE 15 SP5**

This playbook aims to install Trento components and the belonging third parties.

## Components

- [web](https://github.com/trento-project/web)
- [wanda](https://github.com/trento-project/wanda)
- [agent](https://github.com/trento-project/agent)
- postgresql
- rabbitmq
- prometheus
- nginx

The third parties are installed using `zypper` packages and configured with dedicated roles.

`web` and `wanda` components are installed using containers with the rolling images.

The `agent` is installed from the configured obs repository using `zypper`.

The nginx configuration acts as a reverse proxy for all the components.

### SUSE LINUX ENTERPRISE USERS

This playbook assumes you have an activated license of `Suse Linux Enterprise 15 SP5`, with these modules

- Basesystem Module 15 SP5 x86_64 - `SUSEConnect -p sle-module-basesystem/15.5/x86_64`
- SUSE Package Hub 15 SP5 x86_64 - ` SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/15.5/x86_64`
- Containers Module 15 SP5 x86_64 - `SUSEConnect -p sle-module-containers/15.5/x86_64`

## Usage

You can clone this repository and use them as a normal ansible playbook, making all the updates you need to make to injected variables, embedding other tasks and so on.

We provide two examples to run the playbook as-is without further modifications.

### With local ansible

- Obtain the playbook, like git cloning this repository
- Create an [ansible inventory file](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory_guide/intro_inventory.html)
- Create a json file containing the variables for the playbook or pass them via cli
- Run provision command

**Example inventory to install the trento-server and provision postgres, rabbitmq and prometheus all on the same host**

```yaml
all:
  children:
    trento-server:
      hosts:
        vitellone:
          ansible_host: "your-host"
          ansible_user: "your-user"
    postgres-hosts:
      hosts:
        vitellone:
          ansible_host: "your-host"
          ansible_user: "your-user"
    rabbitmq-hosts:
      hosts:
        vitellone:
          ansible_host: "your-host"
          ansible_user: "your-user"
    prometheus-hosts:
      hosts:
        vitellone:
          ansible_host: "your-host"
          ansible_user: "your-user"
```

**Example json variables file to install trento-server with the all in one node configuration**

```json
{
    "web_postgres_password": "pass",
    "wanda_postgres_password": "wanda",
    "rabbitmq_password": "trento",
    "prometheus_url": "http://localhost",
    "web_admin_password": "adminpassword",
    "trento_server_name": "your-server-name"
}
```

        vitellone:
          ansible_host: "your-host"

}
```

**Example inventory to install the trento agents**

```yaml
all:
  agents:
    hana01:
      ansible_host: "your-hana01-host"
      ansible_user: root
    hana02:
      ansible_host: "your-hana02-host"
      ansible_user: root
```

**Example json variables file to install trento agents**

```json
{
    "trento_server_url:": "http://localhost",
    "rabbitmq_host": "localhost",
    "trento_api_key": "api-key-obtained-from-server"
}
```

> **Note**: <br />
> to have a fully functional deployment make sure to use either an **external IP** or an **internal IP** for `rabbitmq_host` based on the infra network configuration. <br />
> Additionally, retrieving the actual api-key from the server is not supported yet, so use `"enable_api_key": "false"` in extra vars as any value in `trento_api_key` would be ineffective.

Both trento-server and agent inventory and variables file can be combined to deploy both at the same ansible execution.

Having an inventory file called `inventory.yml` and a vars file called `extra-vars.json`, you could run the playbook

```bash
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml --extra-vars @extra-vars.json playbook.yml
```

**This is just an example you can use all the options of `ansible-playbook` with your inventory and other methods of variables injection.**

### With docker container

You can use the docker image `a`, to run this playbook, the image contains the playbook files ready to be provisioned.
The docker image assumes you mount an `inventory` file and an `extra-vars` file.

Mounting your ssh socket will enable you to access the remote machines like in your local environment.

Assuming you have in the current folder a file called `inventory.yml` and `extra-vars.json`

```bash
    docker run \
        -e "SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/ssh-agent" \
        -v $(pwd)/inventory.yml:/playbook/inventory.yml \
        -v $(pwd)/extra-vars.json:/playbook/extra-vars.json \
        -v $SSH_AUTH_SOCK:/ssh-agent \
        ghcr.io/trento-project/ansible:rolling /playbook/inventory.yml /playbook/extra-vars.json
```

## Clean up

In order to clean up most of the applied changes and created resources, the `playbook.cleanup` playbook could be used. It uses the same inventory and variables file than the main playbook.

These are the cleaned resources:
- Web and Wanda containers/images
- Docker network
- Postgresql database and users
- Nginx vhost configuration file
- RabbitMQ vhost

Run the playbook with:

```bash
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml --extra-vars @extra-vars.json playbook.cleanup.yml
```

**Disclaimer: The installed packages are not removed as most of the times they are of general usage, and this could have impact in many other services.**

## Usage with vagrant

You can test the playbook using vagrant, the default configuration in this repository assumes that you have VirtualBox, change it to what matches your setup.

The `Vagrantfile` contains sane defaults for running the playbook, it assumes that you have `trento.local` as `localhost` alias in your `/etc/hosts`.

You can reach the trento application using `https://trento.local:8443`.

The Vagrantfile contains a self signed certificate for `trento.local` domain, make sure you accept the exception when prompted by your browser.

Start the vagrant box

```bash
$ vagrant up
```

This will spawn a vagrant box with `Opensuse Leap 15.4` as base box. The provisioning will be automatic after the box starts.

Force provision the vagrant box

```bash
$ vagrant provision
```

Use this command when you want to reprovision (re-run the ansible playbook) the vagrant box, you could use this to rerun the playbook if you are in the development process or you want to change some variables.
