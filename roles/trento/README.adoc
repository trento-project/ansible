= Trento Ansible Meta-Role

Special role containing only variables that enables sharing of these
common variables between various other trento-related roles.

The intended way of using is by adding this role as dependency to
other roles in their `meta/main.yml`.

Please, strongly consider if the variable really needs to be added as
a common variable.

== Requirements

This role has no external dependencies.

== Role Variables

We keep all our variables documentation in the main README of the collection.


== Dependencies

This role has no dependencies.
